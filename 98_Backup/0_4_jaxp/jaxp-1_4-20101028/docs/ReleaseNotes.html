    <p>
       In this release, we have included 77 changes, improvement and bug fixes for JAXP and SJSXP.
       Most of the fixes went into JDK6 update 18 and OpenJDK7 M5. A few more recent fixes would
       go into future JDK6 update release and OpenJDK7 M6.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Important changes and improvement</b>
        <p>
            Changes and bug fixes are listed in the <a href="changelog.html">JAXP 1.4.3 Change Log</a>.
            The followings are some important changes and improvement.
        </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Secure processing<br>
        The <a href="https://jaxp.dev.java.net/1.4/JAXP-Compatibility.html#JAXP_security">Feature for Secure Processing</a>
        in JAXP has been enhanced and several issues have been resolved to improve security in XML processing in the JDK.
        Refer to <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/security/category/news">Sun Security Blog</a> for Advance notification of
        Security Updates for Java SE.<br><br></br>

        </li>
        <li>Performance improvement<br>
        There have been several performance improvement in XML parsing, validation and transformation reflected in the SPECjvm2007 and
        SPECjvm2008 benchmark tests. The biggest improvement was made against early JDK6 release when a 87% gain was
        registered in the overall XML score. Other than that, there have also been single percentage improvement in various
        areas. <br><br>

        <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Conformance<br>
        There have been some conformant improvement, especially in the StAX component <a href="http://sjsxp.dev.java.net">SJSXP</a>
        where many conformant requests have been fixed. In July, 2009, <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=173">JSR 173: Streaming API for XML</a>
        passed and finalized <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/maintenance/jsr173/index4.html">Maintenance Review 3</a>.
        The JAXP standalone was then updated to the resulting StAX 1.2 in Oct. 2009.

        The StAX implementation (<a href="https://sjsxp.dev.java.net">SJSXP) in this release has been upgraded to
        <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=173">JSR 173: Streaming API for XML</a>
        <a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/maintenance/jsr173/index4.html">Maintenance Review 3</a>, that is,
        StAX 1.2.
        <br><br>
